# EchoSonar
A compilation of custom and third-party tools and code workflows for Ecoacoustic and Bioacoustic research.

Here, I compile several tools and code useful in Ecoacoustics and Bioacoustics research. I combine custom and third-party Python and R scripts. Applications extend to acoustic data processing and analysis, including spectrogram generation, automated species detection, and the use of BirdNET or Scikit-Maad. I contribute custom codes for the optimization of acoustic data processing and collaborative cloud running with Colab.

You are invited to collaborate, and do not hesitate to make a pull request.
