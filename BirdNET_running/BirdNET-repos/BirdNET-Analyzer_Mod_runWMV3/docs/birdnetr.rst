BirdNET in R
============

We do also provide a BirdNET package for R, which allows you to analyze audio recordings directly in R.

|birdnetR|_ is geared towards providing a robust workflow for ecological data analysis in bioacoustic projects. 
While it covers essential functionalities, it doesn't include all the features found in BirdNET-Analyzer. 
Some features might only be available in the BirdNET Analyzer and not in this package.


|birdnetTools|_ is designed to streamline the post-processing and validation of output from BirdNET.
It includes functions for filtering detections by species, confidence, and date/time; visualizing temporal patterns;
and validating detections with an interactive Shiny app to support threshold-setting workflows. 


.. note::
    Please note that both packages are under active development, so you might encounter changes that could affect your current workflow.
    We recommend checking for updates regularly.
